# Database System Course

This repository contains materials related to the Database System Course that I took during 2nd semester of my first year in 2023. The course covered the fundamentals of database systems, including data modeling, relational algebra, SQL, and database design. 

## Contents

- `lectures/`: This directory contains the lecture slides and notes for each class session.
- `assignments/`: This directory contains the assignments that were given throughout the course.
- `project/`: This directory contains the final project that I completed for the course.
- `resources/`: This directory contains additional resources that I found useful during the course, such as textbooks, articles, and online tutorials.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in learning more about database systems, feel free to browse the materials in this repository. The lecture slides and assignments are a good place to start if you're new to the subject. If you want to dive deeper, check out the resources directory for additional materials.

## Final Project

For my final project, I designed a database system for a fictitious airline that sells airline tickets for multiple flight schedules. The system allows users to browse and purchase airline tickets for specific dates and times. Once a ticket is booked, users will be prompted to complete the payment process. Additionally, the system allows the Database Admin to view all procedures and records that are stored every time a customer books a ticket. The project is included in the `Airline-Reservation-Database/` directory, along with any necessary files and documentation.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Mr. Welly Purnomo for teaching the Database System Course and providing the materials that are included in this repository. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of my classmates, who helped to make the course a collaborative and engaging learning experience.
